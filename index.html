<center><p style="width:39%;">Custom firmware is essentialy applications and software that can be installed on a 3DS, but are not by Nintendo, or from the E-Shop. CFW can be used for many things. Custom home menu themes, mods of your favorite games, emulators, and you can even make digital backups of your games!</p>

  <h1><font face="monospace" color="darkslategrey">So, how does this all work?</font></h1>
  <p style="width:39%;">Some very important programmers have found <i>exploits</i> in the code of games and even <a href="http://soundhax.com/">official Nintendo apps</a> that allow unsigned code to be executed in the 3DS. The unsigned code is used to create games and applications, such as a Portal remake, an app that gives you a full PlayCoin meter, and apps that can display system specs.

    Cool, but who makes these?
    </h1></font>
    <p style="width:39%;">Some examples of the talented people who make these hacks and applications are Nedwill (creator of SoundHax) and Smealum (creator of NinjaHax and HBLauncherLoader + more.) These developers spend lots of their freetime assuring that users will be able to get their shacking fix.</p>

  <h1><font face="monospace" color="dodgerblue">Awesome, where do I start?</h1></center></font>
  

  <center>
  <p style="width:39%;">You can start by installing Boot9Strap, the user-friendly orientation of <b>Sighax</b>. Boot9Strap is an updated CFW that replaced Arm9LoaderHax, as LumaCFW will no longer support A9LH.

<center><p style="width:39%;">So, what have we learned? Well, we have learned that <b>CFW is a payload for the 3DS that can run unsigned code</b>, <b>there are many people that work to keep the 3DS hacking scene alive</b> and <b>there are many options for CFW and the scene is always changing</b>.
