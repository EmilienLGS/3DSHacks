Custom home menu themes, mods of your favorite games, emulators, and you can even make digital backups of your games!</p>

  <h1><font face="monospace" color="darkslategrey">So, how does this all work?</font></h1>
  <p style="width:39%;">Some very important programmers have found <i>exploits</i> in the code of games and even <a href="http://soundhax.com/">official Nintendo apps</a> that allow unsigned code to be executed in the 3DS. The unsigned code is used to create games and applications, such as a Portal remake, an app that gives you a full PlayCoin meter, and apps that can display system specs.

    Cool, but who makes these?
    </h1></font>
    <p style="width:39%;">Some examples of the talented people who make these hacks and applications are Nedwill (creator of SoundHax) and Smealum (creator of NinjaHax and HBLauncherLoader + more.) These developers spend lots of their freetime assuring that users will be able to get their shacking fix.</p>
