<center>Custom firmware is essentialy applications and software that can be installed on a 3DS, but are not by Nintendo, or from the E-Shop. CFW can be used for many things. Custom home menu themes, mods of your favorite games, emulators, and you can even make digital backups of your games!

  Some very important programmers have found <i>exploits</i> in the code of games and even <a href="http://soundhax.com/">official Nintendo apps</a> that allow unsigned code to be executed in the 3DS. The unsigned code is used to create games and applications, such as a Portal remake, an app that gives you a full PlayCoin meter, and apps that can display system specs.

    Cool, but who makes these?
    </h1></font>
    Some examples of the talented people who make these hacks and applications are Nedwill (creator of SoundHax) and Smealum (creator of NinjaHax(2.0), and HBLauncherLoader.) These developers spend lots of their freetime assuring that users will be able to get their shacking fix.
